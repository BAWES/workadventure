# Build your Map with Tiled

This document will guide you through the process of creating your own map for WorkAdventure using the **Tiled** editor.

:::info
If you are looking to do a simple customization of an existing map, like placing furniture or editing entries and
exits, you should read the [Customize your map](../inline-editor/index.md) guide instead.
:::

## Tools you will need

In order to build your own map for WorkAdventure, you need:

- the [Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software
- "tiles" (i.e. images) to create your map
- a web-server to serve your map

WorkAdventure comes with a "map starter kit" that we recommend using to start designing your map quickly. It contains **a good default tileset** for building an office and it proposes to **use Github static pages as a web-server** which is both free and performant. It also comes with a local web server for testing purpose and with TypeScript support (if you are looking to use the [Map Scripting API](/developer/map-scripting/)).

:::info
If you are looking to host your maps on your own webserver, be sure to read the [Self-hosting your map](hosting.md) guide.
