# Getting started to download your map

Start by [creating a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.

Then, go to the [Github map starter kit repository page](https://github.com/workadventure/map-starter-kit) and click the **"Code"** button.

Then click on the Download ZIP button

Make the changes you want in Tiled and to upload you only need to log in to your administrators account, go to the world you want, then click “create a new room”, once there you can go to the Custom section.

Here you'll be asked for the URL of the Json file on your github server. Once you've entered it, just click on create.
